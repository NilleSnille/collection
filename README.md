This repository showscases some of my previous work and projects, sorted into their respective fields - including my masters thesis on how deep reinforcement learning can be used to optimize datasets when training object detection models. 

# Current Reasearch

Currently doing reasearch at Lund University on the use and applications of unfolding/unrolling algorithms in signal processing, specifically to solve the Room Impulse Response Interpolation computation efficiently. More information about the unroling method - a way to solve iterative optimization algorithms with explainable deep neural networks - can be found in this great paper. 

[Algorithm Unrolling: Interpretable, Efficient Deep Learning for Signal and Image Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10557)

For information about the Room Impulse Response Interpolation method, see the below paper.

[Room Impulse Response Interpolation Using a Sparse Spatio-Temporal Representation of the Sound Field](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7987742)

The idea is to unfold the ZeroFPR algorithm into a neural network, utilizing both GPU paralellization and learnability to improve performence and accuracy.
