This repository showscases some of my previous work and projects, sorted into their respective fields - including my masters [thesis](https://github.com/NilleSnille/collection/tree/main/Thesis%20-%20Data%20Augmentation%20for%20Object%20Detection%20using%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning) on how deep reinforcement learning can be used to optimize datasets when training object detection models. 

The thesis is published [here](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9148803).

# Current Reasearch

Currently doing reasearch at Lund University on the use and applications of unfolding/unrolling algorithms in signal processing, specifically to solve the Room Impulse Response Interpolation computation efficiently while maintaining the explainability of the solution. More information about the unroling method - a way to solve iterative optimization algorithms with explainable deep neural networks - can be found in this great paper.

[Algorithm Unrolling: Interpretable, Efficient Deep Learning for Signal and Image Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10557)

For information about the Room Impulse Response Interpolation method, see the below paper.

[Room Impulse Response Interpolation Using a Sparse Spatio-Temporal Representation of the Sound Field](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7987742)

The idea is to unfold the ZeroFPR algorithm into a neural network, utilizing both GPU paralellization and learnability to improve performance and accuracy, while maintaining the explainability often lost with deep learning approaches.
