# Data Augmentation for Object Detection using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This Master's thesis explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance data augmentation processes in object detection tasks within computer vision. Traditional data augmentation involves randomly applying transformation functions to images to improve model training. This research investigates whether a DRL agent can intelligently select augmentation strategies to boost the performance of an object detection model more effectively.

## Key Findings

- The DRL agent developed during this project successfully augmented images to increase the mAP50 performance metric of an object detection model by 2.3% over a baseline model trained with random augmentations.
- This result not only demonstrates the potential of using DRL for data augmentation in improving model performance but also provides insights into what constitutes effective data augmentation in object detection.

## Contributions

This thesis represents the first known attempt to apply a deep reinforcement learning agent for data augmentation in object detection, highlighting a promising avenue for further research in this area.
