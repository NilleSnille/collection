# Network Analysis and Optimization Studies

This repository consolidates my exploratory work and studies in the field of Network Analysis and Optimization. It contains detailed notes on Network Centrality Measures, Optimum Traffic Assignment Problems, and the dynamics within Network Games. These documents serve as a theoretical foundation and offer insights into complex network behaviors and optimization strategies.

## Overview of Contents

- **[Single Particle Dynamics and Network Games](Single%20Particle%20Dynamics%20and%20Network%20Games.pdf)**: Insights into the interaction of single particle dynamics with network games, highlighting the strategic implications and outcomes of these dynamics on network behavior.

- **[Notes on the Optimum Traffic Assignment Problem and Equilibrium](Notes%20on%20the%20Optimum%20Traffic%20Assignment%20Problem%20and%20Equilibrium.pdf)**: A dive into the optimum traffic assignment problem, discussing the concept of equilibrium and its significance in traffic flow optimization across networks.

- **[Notes on Network Centrality Measures and their Application](Notes%20on%20Network%20Centrality%20Measures%20and%20their%20Application.pdf)**: An examination of centrality measures within networks, focusing on their applications in analyzing the importance of nodes in various network structures.

## Purpose

The purpose of this collection is to provide an accessible resource for those interested in network theory, from centrality measures to optimization problems and the interplay of dynamics in network games.
