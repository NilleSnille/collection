Here I showcase some of my work on Monte Carlo methods. 

"Simple Monte Carlo methods for Power Estimation in Wind Turbine" is more focused on different methods and their empirical results in terms of bias and variational properties.  

"Sequetial Monte Carlo and Self Avoiding Walks" is more interesting from a theoretical viewpoint - here it is showedcase both theoretically and empirically how different sequential MC methods can greatly increase the performance in sequential settings over more naive approaches.

"Change Points" show how the crucial statistic of Change Points in data can be determined using MC methods. This is vital for analyzing historical data to detect shifts in trends, behaviors, or regimes, enabling more accurate predictions and understanding of the underlying system dynamics.
